TODOS:
  * Clean up all canvas drawing tools. (should not refer to bodies, should refer only to shapes)
  * Write more canvas drawing tools. (add surface set drawing function)
  * Documentation on
    * geometry/*
    * physics/*
  * Drawing utilities for OwnedShapes
  * Discuss the fate of BODY_LINK_TYPEs
  * Move surface friction out of the Surface class. Surface knows nothing about physics.
  * DECIDE: CirclePhysics move to single surface? (probably)
