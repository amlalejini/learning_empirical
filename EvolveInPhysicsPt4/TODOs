TODOS:
  * Write more canvas drawing tools. (add surface set drawing function)
    * canvas_utils still assumes Surface<Circle>
  * Documentation on
    * geometry/*
    * physics/*
  * Discuss the fate of BODY_LINK_TYPEs
  * Move surface friction out of the Surface class. Surface knows nothing about physics.
  * Implement a BodyCollisionInfo struct:
    * bool resolved
    * dist, overlap, force, etc.
  * Document all template assumptions: Ex: body owners must have functions x,y, and z.
