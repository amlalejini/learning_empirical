# learning_empirical

## onemax
 * Implementation of onemax. First attempt at learning to use Empirical.

## EvolveInPhysicsPt1
 * First attempt at incorporating physics into evolving organisms.
 * Environment: 2D physics world, nutrients A, B
 * Organisms: Defined by bit string genome
  - A nutrient pull: sum(0) in genome
  - B nutrient pull: sum(1) in genome
 * Replicate after collecting 10 nutrients
 * '''modified_geometry/'''
  - Copy of Empirical's geometry/ directory.
    * This copy exists because there are a few modifications that need to be made for this project. Well, maybe. Eventually, we'll switch back to Empirical's geometry tools.
